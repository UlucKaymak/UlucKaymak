# Hi I'm ULUÃ‡ KAYMAK
A person who loves learning and creating new things.

I am a multidisciplinary artist who combines conceptual art with the figurative aspects of the culture I was born and raised, in auditory and/or visual, interactive, and algorithmic forms. My projects often revolve around themes such as human perception, experience, and psychology.

On my personal projects, I work on fractured emotions and thoughts through various forms of digital projection, focusing on interactive audio-visual experience.
