Hi I'm
## ULUÃ‡ KAYMAK
A person who loves learning and creating new things.

I am a multidisciplinary artist who combines conceptual art with the pieces of the culture I was born and raised in figurative points in auditory and/or visual, interactive and algorithmic forms. My projects often shape around themes such as human perception, experience, and psychology.

On my personal projects, I work on fractured emotions and thoughts through various forms of digital projection, focusing on interactive audio-visual experience.
